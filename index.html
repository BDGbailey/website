  <p> Occupational Reveiw </p>
  <p>Gonna do the review of Occupations I prefer, hopefully make three pages</p>

<!--Describe the methods and equiptment on differnt sections in the future/ use bullet points beneath the description of each occupation, try to dial down emotional tones for future reference, homogenize it-->

<h2> Ordered list - most prefered occupations...</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Most preferred: Painter- I had a good level of independence and understanding of the occupation, helped me feel important and that I contributed to my community. Admittedly this is more rose tinted as I haven't been a painter in years, however, it was easy, and after the fact it kind of feels meaningful, since I got credited for helping paint our gym, more than what I can say about most jobs.
      <div> (Equipment involved) We set up scaffolding, sometimes ladders for lower areas, but generally we were up high, about 30 meters high, a story or so. (conclusion) My career as a painter was limited to say the least, more due to me being kind of stupid at the time and taking for granted what I was real </li>
      </div>


      <li>Acceptably preferred: Custodian- even though some may find it degrading, I find the solitude to be therapeutic, because who wants to interrupt someone cleaning the toilet. The level of independence was great, I always love a job where I feel I'm in control of my workspace, not necessarily controlling of others, just knowing that I know what I'm doing and what is expected of my occupation. If there are hiccups, I feel confident I can make it work. (equipment involved) Standard mop and bucket, with a lever to press out excess moisture from mop, other than that, typical cleaning supplies, such as resupplying toilet paper, soap, microfiber clothes, both to replace, clean and utilize. In less, "professional" environments, I tended to be forced to use regular paper towels, back when we could afford such luxuries. (conclusion) Although its perceived as a dirty job, literally someone has to do it, and it came to me, for many years to do it. I'm a Germaphobe that became a janitor, which may not make sense to others, but it makes perfect sense to me, as I utilize my phobia to uncharacteristically cleanse and sanitize all perceived unsanitary conditions, honestly though, considering whatâ€™s happening, this should be my least preferred job, but... </li>

      <li>Least prefered: Sales Clerk- boy oh boy, talk about degrading. the pay was great, excellent even, I intended to work there for years. Then Beuacracy killed my dream of a stable income. The work itself was challenging at times, not because of my inabilities, but because of my percieved abillites, due to management making me belive i was constantly failing no matter what I  did. The ups did outweigh the fautls at times, but even with me fully intending on making it a meaningful job, again, there just wasn't a hope. I realized afterwards I can make any job meaningful, regardless of the occupation, which is why I find this to be the least prefered job, regadless of pay.(equiptment) we used an automated system that was constantly wrong and we woulb be blamed for it, regardless on whether or not it actually was our fault. standard mop and bucke, would't you know it, I was still cleaning toilets, even in this occupation, not neccesarily a bad thing, but I wouldln't want to do it now. microfiber clothe, gotta sanatize all surfaces, regadless of your occupation. (life skills) Most importantly and something I still cherish, was the level of customer satisfaction I could provide, that was the only thing that I miss, even now, well, especially now that I live alone and have no conact with people.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
<!-- What I would like to do, is maybe make a page each of these three occupations, the details involved, such as equiptmend and skills and expand on the information, provide a background and a stock image of each occupation, and conclude with what I've learned as a whole from these experiences-->
</body>
<!-- include pictures related to the occupations, and present them on each page, background, a picture pertinent to the occupation-->
<!--hyperlink each page to a new tab-->
