    <h2> Ordered list - most prefered occupations...</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Most prefered: Painter- I had a good level of independence and understanding of the occupation, helped me feel important and that I contributed to my community. Admittedly this is more rose tinted as I haven't been a painter in years, however, it was easy, and after the fact it kinda feels meaningful, since I got credited for helping paint our gym, more than what I can say about most jobs.(Equiptment involved) We set up scaffolding, sometimes ladders for lower areas, but generally we were up high, about 30 meters high, a story or so.(conclusion) My career as a painter was limited to say the least, more due to me being kinda stupid at the time and taking for granted what I was real </li>
          <li>Acceptibly prefered: Custodian- even though some may find it degrading, I find the solitude to be thereaputic, because who wants to interupt someone cleaning the toilet. The level of indepencence was great, I always love a job where I feel I'm in control of my workspace, not necesarrily controlling of others, just knowing that I know what I'm doing and what is expected of my occupation. If there are hiccups, I feel confident I can make it work.(equptment involved) Standard mop and bucket, with a lever to press out excess moisture from mop, other than that, typical cleaning supplies, such as resuppling toitlet paper, soap, microfiber clothes, both to replace, clean and utilize. In less, "proffessional" enviroments, I tended to be forced to use regulare paper towels, back when we could afford such luxeries. (conclusion) Although its percieved as a dirty job, litterly somone has to do it, and it came to me, for many years to do it. I'm a germaphobe that became a janitor, which may not macke sense to others, but it makes perfect sense to me, as I utilize my phobia to uncharacteristically cleanse and santiize all percieved unsanitary conditions, honestly thouhg, considering whats happening, this should be my least prefered job, but... </li>
          <li>Least prefered: Sales Clerk- boy oh boy, talk about degrading. the pay was great, excellent even, I intended to work there for years. Then Beuacracy killed my dream of a stable income. The work itself was challenging at times, not because of my inabilities, but because of my percieved abillites, due to management making me belive i was constantly failing no matter what I  did. The ups did outweigh the fautls at times, but even with me fully intending on making it a meaningful job, again, there just wasn't a hope. I realized afterwards I can make any job meaningful, regardless of the occupation, which is why I find this to be the least prefered job, regadless of pay.(equiptment) we used an automated system that was constantly wrong and we woulb be blamed for it, regardless on whether or not it actually was our fault. standard mop and bucke, would't you know it, I was still cleaning toilets, even in this occupation, not neccesarily a bad thing, but I wouldln't want to do it now. microfiber clothe, gotta sanatize all surfaces, regadless of your occupation. (life skills) Most importantly and something I still cherish, was the level of customer satisfaction I could provide, that was the only thing that I miss, even now, well, especially now that I live alone and have no conact with people.</li>
        </ol>

<!-- What I would like to do, is maybe make a page each of these three occupations, the details involved, such as equiptmend and skills and expand on the information, provide a background and a stock image of each occupation, and conclude with what I've learned as a whole from these experiences-->
